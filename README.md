# SE-Conveyor-replacer

a space engineer plugin for fixing most conveyor problems in an instant


i wrote this plugin because i was tired of spending hours correctly orienting and placing conveyors without leaving open connections. 

this plugin replaces ANY conveyor even misoriented or wrong type with the conveyor type selected depending on how many connections are connected, AQD armored conveyors mod is supported

works good for now but more testing is needed

This means that when designing your grid you can use any conveyor you want without having to think about orientation or type, as long as they are touching this will work
